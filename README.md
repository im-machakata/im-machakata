# Hello there!

My name is Isaac. I am a **self taught**, aspiring software engineer. I spend most of my time **programming** in PHP, JS, VB, C & C++ and **coding** in mostly HTML & MD. I enjoy **learning how things work** and using that to my advantage to **create** new things from that. Please feel free to get in touch with me if you need my assistance.
